Lab 4 Description

I modeled an Adorondak chair, a classic chair with a long history in American furnishings. 

Steps were taken in the rendering process
1. I modeled everything in Blender. 
2. I added materials in Substance. 
3. I moved the work back into Blender for final render. 

Techniques and tools used for rendering
1. I used a 3 point lighting system which I have used for a lot of models.

Most of my challenges came from understanding how to create parented copies of objects in Blender. Once I got the hang of it, I was editing faster than ever.
